# VesselGraph Generation and Statistics

This prepository hosts all source code and utility scripts for the generation of statistical evaluation of the VesselGraph.

## Analysis

- Provides methods for computing the number of closed loops.
- Provides methods for computing the average distance to bifurcations.

## Graph Generation 

Provides scripts for running voreen in headless mode. 

## Post Processing

Provides script to merge vessels in voreen-based graph extraction. 

## Visualization

Jupyter Notebooks for visualization processes.

## Visualization Scripts

Provides visualization scripts in order to render graph as vtk.
